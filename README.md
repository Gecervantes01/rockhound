# RockHound üîçü™®

**RockHound** is a pocket geologist app designed for outdoor enthusiasts, budding geologists, and anyone with an interest in rocks and minerals. Users can snap a picture of any rock or mineral they find, and the app will use a custom-trained AI model to identify it, providing key information and details about its characteristics.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Rock Identification**: RockHound features an AI model designed to accurately identify rocks and minerals from images. By leveraging machine learning, the app becomes a powerful tool for identifying and understanding the world of geology.
  
- **Interactive AI Chatbot (Rocco the RockHound)**: Engage with Rocco the RockHound, the interactive AI chatbot. Rocco answers your geology-related questions and makes learning about rocks fun!

- **Digital Collection**: Maintain a digital collection of your finds. Users can save identified rocks, revisit them later, and learn more about their geological features.

## Project Focus

The project has evolved to include not only the development of the RockHound mobile app but also the training and refinement of a machine learning model specifically for rock identification. This model is trained using a diverse dataset of rock images, employing techniques such as data augmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in identifying various rock types.
